# The `.wmz` script runtime and host object model

**This file is the canonical reference for what skin JScript can reach.** `WMPObjectModel.swift` is
the executable source of truth; this explains the shape, the rules, and how to add a member without
making the demand tally lie. The probe flags that measure it are in `reference/harness.md`.

---

## The shape

One persistent `JSContext` per **skin session**, on one WMP-owned serial queue
(`WMPScriptContext`). Inside it:

- the skin's own `.js` programs, evaluated **once** at session start, in declaration order;
- every element id of the current view as a global, backed by live element state;
- `player`, `player.controls`, `player.settings`, `player.currentMedia`, `player.currentPlaylist`,
  `player.network`, `eq`, `theme`, `view`;
- WMP's own enumeration constants (`osMediaOpen`, `psPlaying`, …) as globals;
- `setTimeout` / `setInterval` / `clearTimeout` / `clearInterval`, host-executed and bounded;
- nothing else. `ActiveXObject`, `WScript`, `Enumerator`, `VBArray` and `GetObject` are explicitly
  undefined, and a bare JavaScriptCore global has no `fetch`, `require`, `XMLHttpRequest` or file
  API of its own.

`WMPScriptRuntime` is the actor around it: one transaction at a time, expressions then handlers,
returning a `WMPScriptOutput` of scene overrides, host commands, timer requests, diagnostics and the
call trace. Reads answer off an immutable `WMPHostSnapshot`; writes become typed host commands the
main actor applies. Nothing in the model touches `AudioEngine`, AppKit or the file system.

**Why it is in-process at all** — and what that costs — is Amendment 2 in
`docs/wmp-skin/phase-0-decision-record.md`. Read it before changing the boundary.

## The three resolutions

Every member access is recorded as one of these, and `WMP_CALL_TRACE` prints them as `ok`, `INERT`
and `UNRECOGNISED`:

| Resolution | Meaning | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `live` | a real host value or a real effect | answers, or posts a command |
| `inert` | recognised, answered, nothing behind it | answers a documented default; **counted separately** |
| `unrecognised` | not implemented | throws, aborting *that handler only*, and is tallied as demand |

`inert` exists because of the most expensive class of phantom bug this subsystem can carry: a member
that is recognised and returns something plausible disappears from the demand tally and reads, from
every instrument, exactly like a working one. Some members cannot be anything else — `theme.loadString`
names a string inside `wmploc.dll`, which does not exist on macOS — so they answer and say so.

**The rules that follow from that:**

1. **Do not add a member you cannot implement.** If it has no host behind it, mark it `inert()`.
2. **Unimplemented is a queue, not a set.** Each member added lets the scripts run further and
   surfaces the next one. Re-measure with `WMP_CALL_TRACE=1` after every change; never work down a
   static list.
3. **Fail closed per handler, never per session.** There is no `scriptsDisabled`. A skin puts its
   whole startup in one handler, so one missing member already costs many unrelated features; a
   session-wide kill switch made that invisible instead of visible.
4. **Member lookup is case-insensitive.** WMP's objects are IDispatch and the corpus spells the same
   member both ways in one file (`player.currentMedia.getItemInfo` and
   `player.currentmedia.getiteminfo`). A case-sensitive bridge answers `undefined` for a call that
   works in WMP.

## Elements

Every element id is a global, and a write to one of its properties mutates the retained graph and
marks it dirty. Element state lives for the whole session: that is the difference between a click
that toggles a pane and a click that does nothing.

The **property** surface is open — a WMP element carries far more properties than this engine draws,
and refusing `hoverFontStyle` on a `TEXT` would abort the handler that sets it, which in Corona is
the whole of `InitControls`. An unauthored, undrawn property is stored and answers `inert`, so the
census can rank "properties skins set that nothing renders" instead of losing them.

The **method** surface is closed. `WMPObjectModel.elementMethodVocabulary` lists the names WMP
defines as element methods; one of those that this engine does not implement stays `unrecognised`
rather than falling into the open property surface. Without that, `svPlaylist.moveTo(…)` reads as an
empty string, dies with a bare `TypeError`, and never appears in the tally that ranks the work.

Implemented today: `moveTo`, `resizeTo` (endpoint applied immediately — the tween is *not* drawn
yet), `appendItem`/`removeAllItems`/`getItem` on `POPUP`, `setColumnResizeMode` on the playlist
kinds including the unmodelled `ITEMSPLAYLIST`, and `close`/`minimize` on the view.

---

## Geometry expressions

A `JScript:` geometry attribute is evaluated in the real context, so `view.width - svMain.left`
works because `view` and `svMain` are the same live objects the handlers see, and
`Half(view.width)` works because the skin's own `.js` declared `Half`.

Two rules that are not obvious and are both paid for:

- **The owning element is in scope.** Corona's `width="JScript:svBottomLeft.width-left;"` means
  *this* element's `left`. The expression is evaluated inside `with (thisElement)`, and the proxy's
  `has` trap answers **only** for properties the element genuinely owns — not the open surface —
  because an element that claims every identifier swallows the skin's own functions. That exact
  mistake made `GetEqSliderLeft(1)` resolve to an empty string and cost all ten equaliser sliders
  their geometry.
- **A trailing semicolon is authored.** The corpus writes `JScript:view.width-svMain.left;`, which
  is a syntax error inside a `return (…)`.

Expressions resolve in dependency order, measured by running them once and recording what each one
read. A failing expression costs **itself and nothing else**, and a cycle costs only the keys inside
it. The model this replaced emptied the whole ordered list on any single failure (W21).

---

## Timers

`setTimeout`/`setInterval` record a bounded request and keep the **function**, not its text: the
request's `source` is `__wmpTimer:<token>` and firing it invokes the stored closure. Re-evaluating a
function's text — all a stateless runtime could do — loses every variable it captured, which is most
of what a skin's timers are for. Count and minimum period stay inside `WMPPhase0Limits`.

## Adding a member

1. Measure first: `WMP_CALL_TRACE=1` over the corpus, and take the top `UNRECOGNISED` row.
2. Implement it in `WMPObjectModel` — `live` if there is a host behind it, `inert()` if there is
   not, and leave it out entirely if neither is honest.
3. Add it to `WMPJScriptCompatibility.members` in the same change; that table is what the census's
   static `UNKNOWN member` tally is measured against.
4. Re-measure. The next member is now visible; the list you started from is already stale.
