# The `.wmz` harness — canonical probe reference

**This file is the only place a `.wmz` probe flag or corpus command is documented.** Every other
file, comment and handoff points here and never restates a command. When you add a flag, add it
here in the same change.

Everything below runs headlessly through `swift test`. Nothing here is compiled into the app.

---

## Why the harness exists

Structural and load-time cleanliness measure almost nothing. The `.wal` subsystem paid for that
first: *a vertical-flip and a wrong crop origin survived 490+ green tests because nothing ever
rendered a frame.* `.wmz` reached 6,044 lines of engine with every real-skin test `XCTSkip`ped, so
`swift test` stayed green while 4 of 14 corpus archives were being rejected outright.

So: **you cannot rank work you cannot measure**, and a probe is not trusted about an absence until
it has been shown reporting a presence.

---

## The corpus

Installed skins live outside the repo, matching the `.wal` convention:

```
~/Library/Application Support/NullPlayer/WMPSkins/
```

`WMPSkinImporter.swift` installs there. Archives are never committed; only per-skin `.md` notes are.

**Enumeration rule.** `*.[wW][mM][zZ]`, `-type f`. A bare `*.wmz` drops an upper-case spelling and a
bare `*` picks up directories. Every script **prints the count it measured and never asserts a fixed
one** — the corpus moves, and a document quoting a frozen number goes wrong in a way that looks
right. Each row carries a sha256 so byte-identical archives under two filenames are visible as
duplicates instead of counted twice.

---

## The probe flags

All of them are read by `WMPRenderDumpTests/testSweepsSkinOrCorpus`
(`Tests/NullPlayerAppTests/WMPRenderDumpTests.swift`).

| Flag | Value | What it prints |
|---|---|---|
| `WMP_SKIN` | file **or directory** | the archive(s) to measure — required |
| `WMP_RENDER_DUMP` | directory | one PNG per view; per-skin subdirectory in a sweep |
| `WMP_RENDER_PROBE` | `all` or a view id | `PROBE` — every drawn node's type, id, resolved frame, clip, z, paint and authored attributes; plus a `WIDGET` line per widget — the AppKit-hosted surfaces the scene image does **not** contain |
| `WMP_RENDER_BITMAPS` | `1` | `BITMAPS` — resolved count and every path that failed to load, with `missing=` |
| `WMP_RENDER_SCRIPTS` | `1` | `SCRIPTS`/`SCRIPT` — per program: bytes, declared handlers, and the runtime's availability |
| `WMP_RENDER_EXPR` | `1` | `EXPR` — every `JScript:` geometry expression, its source, both evaluators' values, its dependency order and deps |
| `WMP_CALL_TRACE` | `1` | `CALL`/`CALLS` — every host object-model access with receiver, member, value, and how it resolved: `ok`, `INERT` or `UNRECOGNISED` |
| `WMP_RENDER_CLICK` | `<view>@x,y[;x,y…]` | `CLICK` — the object hit, handler count, every attribute changed anywhere in the graph, the host command reached, and the state after |
| `WMP_RENDER_SETTLE` | seconds | run the **view's own timer loop** for that long before measuring — at the period the skin asks for, honouring every `setViewTimerInterval` its handlers post back, rebuilding the scene between ticks |
| `WMP_RENDER_SIZE` | `<W>x<H>` | build at that size and re-drive `onResize` — an expression-driven layout is a *different* layout, not the same one scaled |

`WMP_TEST_WMZ` and `WMP_RENDER_DUMP_DIR` are accepted aliases for `WMP_SKIN` and `WMP_RENDER_DUMP`
so the Phase 0–8 handoff docs' invocations still run. Use the names in the table.

One archive:

```bash
WMP_SKIN=~/Library/Application\ Support/NullPlayer/WMPSkins/corona.wmz \
WMP_RENDER_EXPR=1 WMP_CALL_TRACE=1 WMP_RENDER_SCRIPTS=1 \
  swift test --filter WMPRenderDumpTests/testSweepsSkinOrCorpus > /tmp/wmp/corona.txt 2>&1
```

**`WMP_SKIN` takes a directory and sweeps it inside one process invocation.** The `.wal` sweep does
79 archives in ~5 minutes where a shell loop over them took 25, and the test-binary startups were
nearly all of the difference. One invocation also cannot be invalidated halfway — a sweep is a
build, and an edit landing mid-loop silently wrote *empty* captures that then diffed as "everything
changed".

A skin that fails to load prints `SKIN <file> FAILED <error>` and the sweep carries on. One broken
archive must not abandon the rest.

---

## The line grammar

Machine-readable, one fact per line, inside a `SKIN <file.wmz>` block. `scripts/wmp_skin_census.sh`
and `scripts/wmp_render_sweep.sh` parse these; do not reword one without updating both.

```

```

`WIDGET` is the only line about the AppKit overlays — playlist, equaliser, popup, effects, video —
and they are **not in the dumped PNG at all**: the renderer draws the scene, and these are `NSView`s
hosted over it. A skin can therefore dump a perfect frame and look wrong on screen, which is exactly
what happened on 2026-09-07 (W43, W9). `visible=none` means the scene clipped the widget out; the
overlay is positioned from `frame`, so a widget with `visible=none` that still shows on screen is a
defect in the hosting, not in the scene.

`INERT` is a member that is recognised, answers, and has nothing behind it — `theme.loadString` can
only ever return the empty string, because there is no `wmploc.dll` on macOS. It gets its own word
and its own census column (`inert_calls`) because a stub that reads as working is the most expensive
bug this engine can carry; `reference/object-model.md` is the contract.

`EXPR` reports **both** evaluators: `->` is the static grammar in `WMPInitialLayoutExpression` that
the scene builder uses, and `live=` is the value the real script context produced. `live=-` with
`#-` means the live pass produced nothing for that key — usually because the topological sort failed
and no expression was evaluated at all. A skin whose static column resolves and whose live column is
empty is not a working skin.

---

## The two committed scripts

### `scripts/wmp_skin_census.sh <outdir> [--corpus <dir>] [--allow-dirty] [--parse-only]`

*What is the state of the corpus?* One TSV row per archive: sha256, whether it loaded, the codes it
was rejected for, encoding, view/node/script counts, findings by code, per-view node/command/hit
counts, resolved and missing artwork, the unimplemented tags and host members it demands, and the
git rev it was measured at. This is the only honest source for the reach numbers in `WMP_TASKS.md`.

`--parse-only` re-derives the TSV from a previous run's logs without paying the sweep again — it is
how a parsing change is checked against a capture that is already known-good.

### `scripts/wmp_render_sweep.sh capture|compare`

*Did my change move anything?* `capture` writes the invariant lines **and** every PNG; `compare`
diffs both. Every engine-wide change from Phase 2 onward passes through this.

```bash
git worktree add ../nullplayer-base HEAD
(cd ../nullplayer-base && scripts/wmp_render_sweep.sh capture /tmp/wmp-sweep/base)
# …make the change…
scripts/wmp_render_sweep.sh capture  /tmp/wmp-sweep/curr
scripts/wmp_render_sweep.sh compare  /tmp/wmp-sweep/base /tmp/wmp-sweep/curr
```

**Never capture the baseline with `git stash`** — it relinks `.build` under the user's running app.

---

## Traps the scripts enforce, inherited rather than re-earned

- **A sweep is a build — freeze the tree.** `capture` and the census refuse a dirty tree without
  `--allow-dirty`. A binary that will not compile writes an *empty* capture that diffs as
  "everything changed". Never run either while the user may be building: SwiftPM lock contention
  stalls both.
- **Redirect to a file and grep the file.** Piping a long `swift test` into a filter drops lines
  silently. stderr gets its own file.
- **Every harness line is one `write(2)`, never `print`.** `WMPHarnessOutput.emit` takes a lock,
  flushes stdio so XCTest's own lines stay ordered against ours, and writes the line and its
  terminator in a single unbuffered call. It exists because `print` did not: in the 180-archive
  sweep at rev `171cf89a` a `CALL` line and the `SKIN` line opening the next archive landed inside
  one another (`CALL vSKIN Windows_XP_Media_Center_Edition.wmz`) and the **5,087 bytes** that should
  have followed — the rest of that skin's trace, two `PNG` lines and a `RENDER-DUMP` — never reached
  the file. It was byte-identical across two full sweeps and did not reproduce on a two-archive
  corpus, so it was the buffered stream, not the content: what is lost is whatever `stdout` was
  holding. Removing the buffer removes the loss. Do not reintroduce `print` here.
- **The damage detectors stay, and one of them is arithmetic.** A splice is only the *visible* half
  of a lost write, and the invisible half is the common one: that same run lost three blocks and the
  prefix scan saw **one**, because the splice consumes the record prefix that would have betrayed
  it. So both scripts also check each loaded block's `RENDER-DUMP` count against the `views=` its own
  `LOAD` line declares (a view that fails still emits `RENDER-DUMP <view> FAILED`), and flag a
  second `LOAD` inside one block. Damaged skins are listed in `damaged.txt`, get a row carrying
  identity and nothing else, and are left out of the diff. Re-run one alone with
  `--corpus <a directory holding just that archive>`. Their PNGs are unaffected and still compare.
- **Compare pixels, not alpha.** Pillow 9.5 made `getbbox()` on an RGBA image consider the alpha
  channel alone, and every dump carries alpha, so a change that moved a visible control but left
  alpha untouched came back "identical" across 590 `.wal` images. `alpha_only=False` in
  `wmp_render_sweep.sh` is load-bearing, not tidiness.
- **A `maxdelta` of 1** is an LSB rounding difference, not a regression. The script reports the
  number; a human reads it.

---

## Proving the instrument

*When a probe reports nothing, check the probe can see the thing at all.* Three `.wal` harness blind
spots each made a real defect look absent. Four checks run on every plain `swift test`
(`WMPRenderDumpTests`) and are the reason the corresponding sweep columns can be believed:

| Test | Proves |
|---|---|
| `testRenderBitmapsProbeReportsAMissingAsset` | `BITMAPS` names a deliberately renamed asset — the Class C detector actually notices an absence |
| `testRenderProbeReportsResolvedFramesForEveryDrawnNode` | `PROBE` reports the frame a node was *drawn at*, not the one it was authored with |
| `testExpressionProbeReportsSourceAndResolvedValue` | `EXPR` reports both the source text and the value it resolved to |
| `testUprightCropColorKeyNestedClipZOrderAndBackingScale` | the renderer's own pixels, at 1× and 2× — the check that nothing else in this table substitutes for |
| `testEmitsEveryLineWholeUnderConcurrentWriters` | eight concurrent writers and 9 KB lines all arrive whole and exactly once — the emitter cannot splice or drop a measurement |

`compare` was checked the same way on 2026-09-07: a one-pixel **colour-only** change (alpha
untouched) to one dumped PNG and a one-character change to one invariant line, each reported.

**Three things a clean sweep does not prove.** It measures the default state and nothing else — not a
tab, a setting, a drag, a hover, or anything driven by live playback. A structural probe is not a
picture: a node existing says nothing about where it is drawn. And **a correct dumped frame is not a
correct window**: the AppKit overlays, the window's shape and its shadow, and every repaint decision
live outside the renderer. On 2026-09-07 the headless `vPlayer` and `viewTiny` frames were correct in
every state tested while the live app showed a dark box the size of the window, drawers that were
never erased, and a black panel during playback. Only the reporter driving the app found any of them.

## What the harness measured on 2026-09-07 (14-skin corpus, rev `055063ed`)

Recorded here because it **contradicts the recovery plan's inherited hand measurement**, which came
from the branch's own phase handoff docs. Those docs are unverified narrative — phase 7 asserts a
release capability gate that its own `AppCapabilities.swift` does not implement — so check every
number from them against the code before relying on it. This is census output.

| Claim in the plan | Census |
|---|---|
| 4 of 14 archives load | **10 of 14 load** |
| 7 of 10 rejections are `WMP0025` (text encoding) | **0 encoding rejections.** The decoder already resolves the corpus: utf16LE ×11, windows1252 ×2 |
| 3 of 10 rejections are `WMP0027` (duplicate attribute) | **all 4 rejections are `WMP0027`** — Alpine7618_v09, anemone, Official_Xbox_XP, The Unit, exactly the four skins measured as carrying duplicate attributes |

So the whole of the Tier-1 loading blocker was the lenient-XML-parser work (`W2`), and the decoder
work (`W1`) was not ranked ahead of it. Two further clusters the census surfaced, which the plan had
folded into later phases:

- **`WMP0032`, 7 views across 5 skins** — "View requires positive literal width and height for
  static layout". A view whose size is computed in script renders nothing at all, which is why
  `claw.wmz` and `iconic.wmz` load cleanly and produce **zero** layouts.
- **`WMP0024`, 2 views** — an *empty* resource attribute rejected as "absolute, drive-qualified, or
  invalid", killing the whole view.

Every count above carries the corpus it was measured against. Do not rewrite an old numerator
against a new denominator.

## After Phase 2 (14-skin corpus, rev `733d3631`)

`load ok=14`. The four `WMP0027` rejections are gone; see `reference/loading.md` for what replaced
the parser and what it now tolerates. Re-measured against the **new 14-archive denominator**, so
these are not comparable line-for-line with the numbers above:

| | rev `055063ed` (10 loading) | rev `733d3631` (14 loading) |
|---|---|---|
| archives loaded | 10 | **14** |
| rejections | 4 × `WMP0027` | **0** |
| `WMP0032` blacked-out views | 7 across 5 skins | 9 across 6 skins |
| `WMP0024` killed views | 2 | 3 |
| `WMP0034` duplicate attributes | — (the code did not exist) | 19 across 4 skins |
| render dumps | 18 PNGs | 25 PNGs |

**What the sweep proved about collateral damage.** All 18 pre-existing PNGs are byte-identical. The
only invariant lines that moved are diagnostic *locations*, and they moved because the new parser
points at a tag's opening `<` where libxml2 reported the position the tag ended at — verified by hand
against `corona.wms`, where `svTop` opens on line 42 and its closing `>` is on line 46. Nothing else
in any block changed: no counts, no node ids, no bitmap resolution, no layout shapes.

**Two Class B defects became visible only because the skins now load** — a probe cannot see a defect
in a skin it rejects, and neither can you:

- `Alpine7618_v09/view-2@1x.png` renders its art in the lower ~150 px of a 517×412 view and flat
  `#FF00FF` everywhere else: the transparency key is not applied to the uncovered background (`W8`).
- `Official_Xbox_XP/mainBox@1x.png` has `WMPWidgetViews`' opaque black `VIDEO` placeholder painted
  over the skin's own artwork (`W9`).

Both were found by *looking at the PNGs*. The census reports both skins as clean loads with resolved
bitmaps, which is exactly the blind spot the harness notes warn about: a structural probe says a node
exists, never that it is drawn right.

## After Phase 3 (180-archive corpus, rev `c8a843e4`)

The script runtime became one persistent `JSContext` per skin session. Loading did not change and
was not expected to; what changed is what runs after it. The census's default pass now drives each
view's own `onLoad`, the way the app does — a harness that skipped it was measuring a skin nobody
sees.

| | rev `ada068ff` | rev `c8a843e4` |
|---|---|---|
| archives loaded | 171 of 180 | 171 of 180 |
| views laid out | 482 | 482 |
| paint commands | 9,120 | **9,186** |
| widgets | 1,396 | **1,436** |
| unresolved nodes | 2,393 | **2,352** |
| `expression-error` corpus-wide | every expression in most skins | **1**, plus 8 `invalid-geometry` |
| distinct `UNRECOGNISED` members | (not comparable — measured statically) | **6** |

`compare`: **442 images identical, 40 differing, none lost, none new.** Every difference is script
state now being applied, and they were looked at rather than counted: `Plus! Aquarium/view-2` went
from a **blank page** to the whole skin; `WoW/videoView` gained the logo its `onLoad` sets;
`Grinch/view-2` and `Plus! SlimLine/perfectVSkin` *lost* pixels because their scripts hide a video
pane and a stray close box when nothing is playing, which is what WMP does.

The remaining 228 handler errors are ranked in `WMP_TASKS.md`, and 102 of them are one missing host
object (`mediacenter`).
