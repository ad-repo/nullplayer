# Winamp 5.x Modern Skins (`.wal`) — ranked open backlog

This is the only live backlog for the Winamp Modern subsystem. A skin is a test case, not a
milestone: take measured capability work from the top down. Closed entries move to
[`docs/winamp-modern/backlog-archive.md`](docs/winamp-modern/backlog-archive.md) in the same change
that closes them. A row that is stale, a question rather than work, or self-described as not worth
doing moves to [`LOW_QUALITY_TASKS.md`](LOW_QUALITY_TASKS.md). This file holds tasks; how the engine
works belongs in `skills/winamp-modern-skin-guide/`.

## Ranking

Measured items are ordered by reach, with effort as an advisory tiebreaker. Reach is corpus demand,
not severity. Live-reported draw defects are kept in their own tier because a screenshot or runtime
observation is not comparable to a static declaration count.

Effort bands: **S** = one attribute/method/local draw fix; **M** = behavior spanning multiple files
without a seam change; **L** = a host seam, protocol change, or new fixture harness.

### Measured capability gaps

| Id | Item | Reach | Effort | Tier |
|---|---|---:|:---:|---|

### Live-reported draw defects

| Id | Item | Reach | Effort | Tier |
|---|---|---:|:---:|---|
| B147 | **The library window follows the main window's height in a `.wal` session.** `toggleHideTitleBars` (`App/WindowManager.swift:511`) resizes the side-docked library and projectM windows by the main window's height delta — Original centre-stack behaviour. Its guard `isRunningModernUI` (`:390`) does not name `WinampModernMainWindowController`, so `.wal` falls through to the stale `isModernUIEnabled` preference. **Gate the resize itself on the mode; do not add the controller to the predicate**, whose other callers would all inherit the answer. Classic and Original byte-identical. The `.wmz` half is W237 in [`WMP_TASKS.md`](WMP_TASKS.md) | every `.wal` session with the library open | S | Live-reported |

### Awaiting manual QA

| Id | Item | Remaining check |
|---|---|---|
| B41 | `getMonitorWidth` / `getMonitorHeight` | Needs a second display. Load Big Bento Modern, move the player to it, open the right-side playlist and toggle **Enlarge Playlist**; the column must size against the player's display, with no 2x oversizing on Retina. Repeat back on the primary display |
| B85 | The Widgets Manager's three place buttons | On a cPro skin: drawer menu -> *Widgets Manager*, then **show in main / drawer / side** on a row. Uninstall and support are expected to stay inert |
| B66 | The Wasabi drop-down's persistence | On Styx's Config, pick a `Position` drop-down entry, reopen the window, confirm the pick survived |
| B110 | Ebonite's frame overlay windows ([record](docs/winamp-modern/backlog-archive.md#b110--a-skins-window-frame-can-be-a-second-window--implementation-record)) | Reporter's confirmation that Ebonite's frames draw, stay glued and stack correctly |

## Agent-verifiable without user input

Triaged 2026-09-27 against the `app-control` tools: `launch.sh`, `winhelper`
(`click`/`dblclick`/`drag`/`move`/`scroll`/`clickdiff`/`capture`/`screens`), `menu.applescript`,
the window census and the render-dump harness. The ranking above still sets the order.

**Partly verifiable.** B147: the fix is autonomous, but *Hide Title Bars* is only in the context
menu, so the live toggle is Route D. B66 and B85: the drop-down and the drawer menu may be
contextual menus; if a synthetic press does not open them, they are Route D.

**Needs the user.** B41 needs a second display (`winhelper screens` shows one). B110 waits on the
reporter's confirmation.

## Reproducible reach commands

All commands use the directories extracted with `7zz` from
`~/Library/Application Support/NullPlayer/WinampModernSkins/` (excluding `ClassicProEngine`). Set
`corpus=/path/to/the/extracted/root`.

**The corpus is 80 `.wal` archives as of 2026-09-27**, so an `[M##]` measured against an earlier
count is not comparable to a new one. **Four are byte-identical re-adds** of installed skins —
`pure_inspired_for_winamp_by_marisa85_d35ix2r` = `Pure Inspired`,
`k_jr_winamp_skin_by_marisa85_d329ymw` = `K-jr`, and the two `dewytears_v2_5_by_dewytear_d2yn025_*`
= `DewyTears_{Pink,Black}GlassV2.5` — so exclude them from any per-skin count.

A command lives here only while an open item cites it; closing the item moves the command into its
archive entry.
